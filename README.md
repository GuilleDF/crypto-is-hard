# Crypto is hard!

These are the code samples used for the talk "Crypto is hard! (don't build your own)" I gave internally at Taxfix.

The implementation for the functions is under `src`, and a few examples on how to use them are in the `scripts` folder. The scripts are ordered from 1 to 10 following the order they were used in the talk. You can run them simply by running:
```bash
$ node scripts/1-caesar.js
```

Enjoy! ðŸ˜ƒ
